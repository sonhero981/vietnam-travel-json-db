Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia hơi.\\n            </h2>\\n            <img src=\\\"https://znews-photo.zadn.vn/w660/Uploaded/mdf_kxrxdf/2019_02_26/mazevietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n            <h1>\\n                <strong>Top things to do in Hanoi</strong>\\n            </h1>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                  Sample the street food\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n              For an authentic taste of Hanoi, look to the street kitchens of the Old Quarter. Steaming pots of its star anise-infused Phở broth simmer on every corner; while every day, the scent of bún chả fills the air as barbecued pork sizzles over hot coals.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Stroll the Old Quarter\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>  \\n            <p>\\n                Hanoi’s Old Quarter serves up a sensory overload.

The elegant Fine Arts Museum houses the country’s foremost collection, such as ancient Cham artifacts and impressionist pieces. For something more contemporary, head for Manzi or the Vietnam Art Gallery. \\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Join the locals at Hoan Kiem Lake\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Hoàn Kiếm Lake rests in the heart of Hanoi.

The Reunification Express line has trains to many major destinations including Lào Cai (Sapa) and Đồng Hới (Phong Nha.) There are many options for getting around Hanoi, including taxis, buses, and motorbikes. Grab, and a few other ride-hailing apps offer on-demand services for getting around. Hanoi’s bus network has an extensive network around the city and low-cost fare.

Flights from Vietnam's major cities connect to Nha Trang, while trains travel the coast, heading either north or south. Buses are easy enough to take from Đà Lạt, Hội An or other neighbouring destinations. Taxis are widely available in Nha Trang city. Motorbike tours are a great way to pop by popular spots, from mud baths to Po Nagar Cham Tower. Cycling is another laid back option.

Tourist buses routinely stop along Mũi Né's main stretch. For train travellers, the nearest station lies in Phan Thiết, a 30-minute drive from Mũi Né. It’s easy enough to walk to local seafood barbeques, shops and beachside stalls. For attractions further away, try hiring a taxi, motorbike or using a ride-hailing app. A shuttle service from the bus and train station is available to most hotels and resorts.\\n            </p>\"",

The other half? Misty sunrises over the water, lazy afternoons swaying in a hammock, and balmy evenings announced by a chorus of insects.
