Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia hơi.\\n            </h2>\\n            <img src=\\\"https://znews-photo.zadn.vn/w660/Uploaded/mdf_kxrxdf/2019_02_26/mazevietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n            <h1>\\n                <strong>Top things to do in Hanoi</strong>\\n            </h1>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                  Sample the street food\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n              For an authentic taste of Hanoi, look to the street kitchens of the Old Quarter.

The elegant Fine Arts Museum houses the country’s foremost collection, such as ancient Cham artifacts and impressionist pieces. For something more contemporary, head for Manzi or the Vietnam Art Gallery. \\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Join the locals at Hoan Kiem Lake\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Hoàn Kiếm Lake rests in the heart of Hanoi.

The Reunification Express line has trains to many major destinations including Lào Cai (Sapa) and Đồng Hới (Phong Nha.) There are many options for getting around Hanoi, including taxis, buses, and motorbikes. Grab, and a few other ride-hailing apps offer on-demand services for getting around. Hanoi’s bus network has an extensive network around the city and low-cost fare.

Flights from Vietnam's major cities connect to Nha Trang, while trains travel the coast, heading either north or south. Buses are easy enough to take from Đà Lạt, Hội An or other neighbouring destinations. Taxis are widely available in Nha Trang city. Motorbike tours are a great way to pop by popular spots, from mud baths to Po Nagar Cham Tower. Cycling is another laid back option.

Tourist buses routinely stop along Mũi Né's main stretch. For train travellers, the nearest station lies in Phan Thiết, a 30-minute drive from Mũi Né. It’s easy enough to walk to local seafood barbeques, shops and beachside stalls. For attractions further away, try hiring a taxi, motorbike or using a ride-hailing app. A shuttle service from the bus and train station is available to most hotels and resorts.\\n            </p>\"",

The other half? Misty sunrises over the water, lazy afternoons swaying in a hammock, and balmy evenings announced by a chorus of insects.

If it’s the first time for you in Vietnam, you won’t see the differences as well. You do not understand people well yet and you are too overwhelming of all impressions. For this reason too, this list of cultural sights and activities is useful when planning your trip.\\n        </h2>\\n        <iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDOJLWkki7A\\\" title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n        <h1>\\n            <strong>Top 10 culture in Vietnam: destinations and activities</strong>\\n        </h1>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                1.

This city is a well-preserved example of a trade port in Southeast Asia that flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries. In its heyday, Hoi An welcomed traders from Japan, China, Spain and the Netherlands and became known as a place of cultural exchange. Nowadays you can experience the culture in the old town through historical museums, heritage houses and of course food and shopping. Rich cultural experiences await around the streets of Hoi An Ancient Town.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                2.

The Chinese were in power at different times in history and the French were for a long time colonial rulers of Vietnam. In Hanoi you will find various buildings, traditions and even food that comes from this colonial era.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                3.

All villages with ethnic minorities (hill tribes) and local markets still feel very unaffected. Thanks to this ethnic diversity, you cannot see more merger traditions than Ha Giang. Each of these ethnic groups has its unique use in the field of marriage, religion, festivals and funeral.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                4.

A lot more is being organized in the field of activities. What is especially nice is the way you can explore this culture; With a trek in Sapa you walk from village to village where you encounter several ethnic groups. You walk through villages where you see the local life and past the rice fields where residents are busy working the land in traditional ways.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                5.

The city represents the power of the disappeared Vietnamese empire. Hue is a city full of monuments, temples, palaces, tombs and pagodas that attract tourists from all over the world and a rightful place in the list of top culture in Vietnam.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                6.

Especially because the Americans have been sitting here for a long time. Not only during the war, but also before trading. For this reason you may have a less old image of the city, but the feeling you get here is unique. Also because the city is the economic center of the country, people from all over have come here. It is actually one big mix of Asian and Western cultures. The buildings also show this; from museums about the Vietnam War to tall skyscrapers, from French colonial buildings to the hippest nightclubs in the country and from ancient Chinese temples to large shopping centers.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                7.

The majority of people in the area are Vietnamese and Khmer, with nearly 2 million people the second largest ethnic group. Because of the different ethnic groups in the Mekong, you will also find different customs, parties and cultures. Because the people live in a delta, the way of life is also different from the rest of Vietnam. Here much more is about water; houses are built on stilts and there are even floating markets.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                8.

This is one of the most popular cities in Vietnam where young Vietnamese come to celebrate their holidays. At lakes, forests, plantations, lookout points and coffee shops you can see young Vietnamese selfies, take photos or complete photo shoots everywhere. The culture around freshly made products such as coffee is particularly large. The special shops and coffee shops where these products are sold are built as uniquely as possible and arranged to receive as many selfie-making Vietnamese as possible.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                9.

The area around Kon Tum houses various ethnic minority communities that are very welcoming when they see a tourist. The area has seen heavy fighting during the war and the city itself has also been destroyed in the last battles of the war.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                10.

You will find here, among other things, the first capital of Vietnam, Hoa Lu. Twelve kilometers from Hoa Lu is the huge Bai Dinh pagoda, which was only opened in 2010. This is the largest Buddhist complex in Southeast Asia. In Trang An there are archaeological sites with evidence of human life in the caves that date back to 30,000 years ago.

Explore Vietnam by motorbike\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/driving-motorbike-vietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            If you travel by motorbike, you will see and experience things that you would never experience if you were traveling by bus or train. There are several ways to do this. The most adventurous people can buy a motorbike in Vietnam and drive from north to south (or vice versa) and sell their motorcycle at their final destination. Such a journey takes a lot of time and can be too extreme for people. Another way would be to rent a motorbike or scooter for a day or longer to discover an area. If you have to choose where you want to do this, then we definitely recommend the Hai Van Pass.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                2. Stay overnight in a cave in Phong Nha\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>  \\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cave-camping-vietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            Explore Son Doong, the largest cave in the world, how great does that sound? But be honest, this is only reality for a handful of people. A trip to the cave takes 5 days and costs around $ 3000 dollars. A more logical option in Phong Nha is the Hang En Cave or Tu Lan. Instead of a week you can do these caves in 2 or 3 days and costs around $ 350.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                3. Canyoning in Dalat\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canyoning-vietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            Canyoning in Dalat is high on the list of many travelers who go to Vietnam for something you just have to do. It is also the highlight of Dalat. What you can expect is abseiling of waterfalls, cliff jumping, natural water slides and hiking through the forest.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                4. Rock climbing in Halong Bay\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/climbing-adventure-vietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            There are a number of places in Vietnam where you can climb, such as Mai Chau and the Marble Mountains near Da Nang. But the most famous place is Halong Bay (and Cat Ba). Halong Bay is one of the most majestic climbing areas in the world. With more than 3000 limestone karst standing in the sea. The area has various climbing routes for both beginners and experienced climbers. Some Halong Bay cruises also include climbing in their travel plans.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                5. Multi-day trekking in Sapa\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/trekking-sapa.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            A day of trekking in Sapa is great. But a multi-day trek is a true adventure and a huge recommendation. This is the most popular and well-known activity in this list, but that doesn’t make this any less cool. During a multi-day trek you walk through the jungle, past the most beautiful rice fields, including fantastic viewpoints. “At night you stay in a homestay, where you experience the life of the local minorities (hill tribes). The more days you go for a walk, the further you go and the fewer people you will encounter.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                6. Kite surfing in Mui Ne\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kite-surfing-mui-ne.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            Mui Ne is the place to be if you want kiteboarding in Asia. Mui Ne beach has safe learning conditions for kite surfing in the morning and early afternoon, and then builds up a little more challenging. This means that the location is suitable for all kite surfers, whether you want to learn, already have experience or if you are a veteran in the sport. There are plenty of schools that you can learn and a nice side effect is that it is also quite cheap here.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                7. Mountain biking in Dalat\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mountain-biking-dalat.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            Dalat is the adventure capital of Vietnam. It is already possible to make a list of the top 10 most adventurous activities in Dalat. In Dalat you will find many hills with forests, perfect for cycling through. Along the way you can stop at local villages of minorities and viewpoints.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                8. Diving in Con Dao\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/diving-con-dao.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            Vietnam is not famous for great diving locations. But good diving in Vietnam is certainly possible. Con Dao is considered the most beautiful coral reef in Vietnam. There are 16 islands and a unique ecosystem here. Also view rare sea creatures here such as sea turtles and sea cows.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                9. Sandboarding and quad biking in Mui Ne\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/quad-driving-mui-ne.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            The white sand dunes have an incredible view of the beach and the surrounding area. You can rent a quad and cruise through the vast, endless sand dunes in search of the perfect vantage point. Race with your new friends or sit back and enjoy your ultimate Vietnam adventure. The red sand dunes offer the perfect opportunity for sand boarding in Mui Ne. For only $ 1 you can rent a mat that lets you slide off the dunes.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                10. Cliff jumping in Nha Trang\\n            </strong>\\n        </p>\\n        <img src=\\\"https://localvietnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cliff-jumping-nha-trang.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            The last in the top 10 adventure activities in Vietnam is cliff jumping in Nha Trang. The best place to jump is at Ba Ho Falls. A one-hour motorcycle ride from Nha Trang, you will find a beautiful and remote waterfall with clear water that begs to be jumped into. Like the jump itself, the walk to the jumping point is quite heavy and slippery so be safe and jump responsible!\\n        </p>\"",

The Pho’s recipe may vary depending on each chef’s own creativity. However, in total, the core ingredients for making an unforgettable bowl of Pho are: Salty Sweet Broth that is made from animal bones (some chefs use chicken’s, some may use pig’s, it really depends), Pho (a typical type of Vermicelli in Vietnam), a mixture of herbs and meat (depends, also). \\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                2.

However, this simplicity, surprisingly, can result in such an amazing taste. \\n            <br><br>\\n            Banh Mi’s most outstanding aspect that makes it become a popular choice in Vietnam might be its convenience. People can find Banh Mi roughly anywhere along the street in each urban region of Vietnam. On your hurry way to work, a 3- minute – preparing Banh Mi would definitely a more appropriate choice than a tradition full course meal. Therefore, it can be said that, in this modern day, Banh Mi has integrated into Vietnamese normal life and it has become a vital part of our nation’s list of cuisine.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                3.

It is really a must -try dish in Vietnam. According to a food blogger named Steph, Vietnamese spring rolls are something that he can never refuse eating, no matter how full he is.\\n            <br><br>\\n            Sure, there is a reason why this dish is regarding as one of best Vietnamese foods.

The dish is often served with fried shallots as well as herbs, and, similar to Bun Cha, a bowl of special sauce.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                7.

This dish is perfect for a super full meal.\\n            <br><br>\\n            This strong flavor, not surprisingly, goes perfectly with the toppings “pile”. Unlike Pho Bo, which is served merely with sliced meat, Bun Bo Nam Bo fulfills even the hungriest stomach with its various toppings: some slices of well-done beef, a part of a pig’s leg, blood pudding, meatballs, some kinds of spring rolls and, of course, a number of herbs. Trying this dish, visitors will be impressed by its unique flavor and certainly, will be able to discover more about various regions’ food identity in Vietnam\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                8.

As it is named, Vietnamese Egg Coffee is made from two main ingredients: Vietnamese black coffee and egg cream. The Egg cream, made from egg and condensed milk, brings culinary enjoyers a strange feeling. It is sweet, it is airy, it is indescribable but it can be mixed so harmoniously with the black coffee. The two come together in the most surprising way, and, even more surprisingly, this combination rocks!\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                9.

This specific type of noodles has its origin from the central province of Quang Nam, Vietnam. Unlike other types of rice noodles, which often have a round appearance and white color, Quang Noodles impress tourists by their two signature features: the flat appearance as well as the specific yellow color.\\n            <br><br>\\n            First, about the noodles’ shape. Quang Noodle, in fact, are pieces of a rice flour layer. This layer is made so thin and then is cut into many small pieces, which are our amazing Quang Noodles (actually, the most appropriate width of these “pieces” should merely be 2 millimeters, such an impressive size!). Continuing with the yellow broth, similar to other broth in Vietnam, this broth is also made by boiling pork bones; however, to get its specific color, a bit of turmeric is added into the water. This interesting addition not only brings the broth a wonderful color but also promotes its strong flavor.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                10.

The best place to jump is at Ba Ho Falls. A one-hour motorcycle ride from Nha Trang, you will find a beautiful and remote waterfall with clear water that begs to be jumped into. Like the jump itself, the walk to the jumping point is quite heavy and slippery so be safe and jump responsible!\\n        </p>\"",

Check into this pristine all-white property and spend your days in its spacious saltwater pool, fine-dining restaurant Le Parfum, and relaxing rooms overlooking the gardens and river beyond.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n               9.

The resort’s untrammelled surrounds are part of a protected national marine park that extends throughout the Côn Đảo archipelago. Rather than mar the natural beauty of Côn Sơn Island, Six Senses Con Dao sticks to an understated aesthetic reminiscent of a traditional fishing village, with bamboo being the material of choice in the villas and rooms. Underneath the minimalist design though, you’ll find state-of-the-art amenities including an award-winning spa and a sophisticated Asian-fusion eatery right on the beach.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            <strong>\\n                10.

Traditional motifs drawn from Vietnamese temples are scattered throughout the villas and interiors. Ornate windows recall the form of Hội An’s flickering lanterns, while carved lions, dragons and other beasts add to the ambiance. The 700-metre private beach is perfect for swimming, sunning or simply sinking your toes into the amber-hued sand.\\n        </p>\"",
