Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia hơi.\\n            </h2>\\n            <img src=\\\"https://znews-photo.zadn.vn/w660/Uploaded/mdf_kxrxdf/2019_02_26/mazevietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n            <h1>\\n                <strong>Top things to do in Hanoi</strong>\\n            </h1>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                  Sample the street food\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n              For an authentic taste of Hanoi, look to the street kitchens of the Old Quarter.

The elegant Fine Arts Museum houses the country’s foremost collection, such as ancient Cham artifacts and impressionist pieces. For something more contemporary, head for Manzi or the Vietnam Art Gallery. \\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Join the locals at Hoan Kiem Lake\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Hoàn Kiếm Lake rests in the heart of Hanoi.

There are many options for getting around Hanoi, including taxis, buses, and motorbikes. Grab, and a few other ride-hailing apps offer on-demand services for getting around. Hanoi’s bus network has an extensive network around the city and low-cost fare.

Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia hơi.\\n            </h2>\\n            <img src=\\\"https://znews-photo.zadn.vn/w660/Uploaded/mdf_kxrxdf/2019_02_26/mazevietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n            <h1>\\n                <strong>Top things to do in Hanoi</strong>\\n            </h1>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                  Sample the street food\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n              For an authentic taste of Hanoi, look to the street kitchens of the Old Quarter. Steaming pots of its star anise-infused Phở broth simmer on every corner; while every day, the scent of bún chả fills the air as barbecued pork sizzles over hot coals.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Stroll the Old Quarter\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>  \\n            <p>\\n                Hanoi’s Old Quarter serves up a sensory overload. Wisps of incense drift out onto streets from ancient temples, while the clang of blacksmiths’ hammers mingles with mobile fruit sellers’ call. Jump in a cyclo and tour this intoxicating maze.

The elegant Fine Arts Museum houses the country’s foremost collection, such as ancient Cham artifacts and impressionist pieces. For something more contemporary, head for Manzi or the Vietnam Art Gallery. \\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Join the locals at Hoan Kiem Lake\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Hoàn Kiếm Lake rests in the heart of Hanoi.

The Reunification Express line has trains to many major destinations including Lào Cai (Sapa) and Đồng Hới (Phong Nha.) There are many options for getting around Hanoi, including taxis, buses, and motorbikes. Grab, and a few other ride-hailing apps offer on-demand services for getting around. Hanoi’s bus network has an extensive network around the city and low-cost fare.
