Wandering these tree-lined lanes past crumbling colonial facades will transport you back in time. However, today's Hanoi is about much more than the past. The ancient city is being invigorated with modern cafes, world-class restaurants, and cool art galleries. When the sun goes down, you have your pick of watering holes, from sophisticated rooftop bars to buzzing bia hơi.\\n            </h2>\\n            <img src=\\\"https://znews-photo.zadn.vn/w660/Uploaded/mdf_kxrxdf/2019_02_26/mazevietnam.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"img\\\">\\n            <h1>\\n                <strong>Top things to do in Hanoi</strong>\\n            </h1>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                  Sample the street food\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n              For an authentic taste of Hanoi, look to the street kitchens of the Old Quarter.

The elegant Fine Arts Museum houses the country’s foremost collection, such as ancient Cham artifacts and impressionist pieces. For something more contemporary, head for Manzi or the Vietnam Art Gallery. \\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Join the locals at Hoan Kiem Lake\\n                </strong>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Hoàn Kiếm Lake rests in the heart of Hanoi.

There are many options for getting around Hanoi, including taxis, buses, and motorbikes. Grab, and a few other ride-hailing apps offer on-demand services for getting around. Hanoi’s bus network has an extensive network around the city and low-cost fare.
